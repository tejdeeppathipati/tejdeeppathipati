Builder mindset. I like taking ideas from zero to shipped.

Right now I am building a reader app that helps people read faster and understand more with AI support. I care about making something people want, then iterating hard.

## What I Build
- AI/ML Systems
- Backend systems that stay reliable when data gets messy
- Agents that take real actions, not just chat

## Strengths
- AI ML engineering: model workflows, evaluation mindset, turning experiments into features
- Backend: clean APIs, auth, data modeling, performance, production habits
- Agentic systems: retrieval, tools, memory, and making automation safe and useful

## Experience
- Data Engineering Intern at Wi-Tronix: image data workflows, dataset curation, and metadata reliability
- Software Engineer Intern: building and maintaining APIs and product features
- CS student at George Mason University

## Current Focus
- Ship the reader app to real users and iterate fast
- Build a marketing agent that can plan, write, and run campaigns end to end
- Turn agent workflows into an AI native agency experiment

## Stack I Actually Use
Python · SQL · Java · TypeScript · PyTorch · TensorFlow · FastAPI · Django · AWS · Postgres · Redis · Docker · Git
