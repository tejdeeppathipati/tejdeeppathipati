builder mindset. i like taking ideas from zero to shipped.

right now i am building a reader app that helps people read faster and understand more with ai support. i care about shipping something people actually use, then iterating hard.

## what i build
- ai powered features that feel simple to the user
- backend systems that stay reliable when data gets messy
- agents that take real actions, not just chat

## strengths
- ai ml engineering: model workflows, eval mindset, turning experiments into features
- backend: clean apis, auth, data modeling, performance, production habits
- agentic systems: retrieval, tools, memory, and making automation safe and useful

## experience
- data engineering internship at :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} working on image data workflows, dataset curation, and metadata reliability
- backend developer internship building and maintaining apis and product features
- cs student at :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} focused on building practical systems while learning the theory

## current focus
- ship the reader app to real users
- push deeper into agents, retrieval, and evaluation
- keep improving my product instincts and technical depth

## stack i actually use
python · sql · java · typescript · pytorch · tensorflow · fastapi · django · aws · s3 · athena · postgres · redis · docker · git
